  ## Description
  This is an application that allows a user to interact with an employee database. They can view different tables, add information, and more. 
  <br><br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: Inquirer, NodeJS, mySQL, JavaScript.
  <br><br>
  It was challenging getting used to the query structure of SQL. Especially getting information from two different tables and joining them.  
  <br>
  I look forward to adding more details and options, along with getting more comfortable with the queries to structure them in more complex ways.
